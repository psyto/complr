# Complr

[![CI](https://github.com/complr/complr/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/complr/complr/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

AI-powered compliance infrastructure for the digital asset industry.

Complr is a **chain-agnostic** compliance platform covering **MAS** (Singapore), **SFC** (Hong Kong), and **FSA** (Japan). It provides a core compliance engine, an SDK for exchanges and VASPs to embed compliance checks into their workflows, and a regulated yield platform demonstrating compliance-first DeFi.

**Multi-chain support**: Complr works with any blockchain. Wallet screening and transaction compliance checks support Ethereum/EVM, Solana, Bitcoin, and other address formats out of the box. The `chain` parameter is optional -- address formats are auto-detected when omitted.

## Phase 0: Core Compliance Engine

### Features

- **Regulatory Queries** -- Ask natural language questions about crypto regulations and get jurisdiction-specific answers grounded in actual regulatory text
- **Transaction Compliance Checks** -- Submit a single transaction and get compliance results across all 3 jurisdictions simultaneously, including Travel Rule applicability, KYC requirements, and action items
- **SAR/STR Generation** -- Auto-draft Suspicious Transaction Reports in regulator-specific formats (FSA STR, MAS STR, SFC STR) in seconds
- **Obligation Extraction** -- Feed in regulatory documents and get structured, actionable obligations with thresholds, penalties, and suggested controls

### Web UI

Open `http://localhost:3000` after starting the server. 4 interactive tabs for all core features.

---

## Phase 1: Compliance Middleware SDK

The SDK wraps the compliance engine into an authenticated API that exchanges and VASPs can integrate via `npm install @complr/sdk`.

### SDK Features

- **Authenticated API** -- Bearer token auth with per-key rate limiting
- **Batch Compliance Checks** -- Check up to 50 transactions in parallel
- **Wallet Risk Screening** -- Multi-chain LLM-powered wallet address risk assessment with auto-detection
- **Webhook Delivery** -- HMAC-signed webhook notifications with exponential backoff retry
- **Usage Tracking** -- Per-key request counts and usage statistics
- **TypeScript-first** -- Full type definitions, zero dependencies

### SDK Quick Start

```typescript
import { ComplrClient } from "@complr/sdk";

const complr = new ComplrClient({
  apiKey: "complr_...",
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
});

// Single transaction check
const result = await complr.checkTransaction({
  transactionId: "tx_001",
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  senderWallet: "0xabc...",
  recipientWallet: "0xdef...",
  amount: "10000",
  currency: "USDC",
  chain: "ethereum",
});

// Batch check
const batch = await complr.checkBatch(transactions);

// Wallet screening (chain auto-detected from address format)
const screen = await complr.screenWallet("0xabc...");

// Or specify chain explicitly
const screenExplicit = await complr.screenWallet("0xabc...", "ethereum", "MAS");

// Webhook management
await complr.registerWebhook("https://your-app.com/webhooks", ["check.blocked", "screen.high_risk"], "your-secret");
```

### API Key Management

```bash
# Generate an API key
curl -X POST localhost:3000/admin/api-keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-exchange"}'

# List all keys
curl localhost:3000/admin/api-keys

# Revoke a key
curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/admin/api-keys/ak_xxx
```

### V1 API Endpoints

All `/api/v1/*` routes require a Bearer token via the `Authorization` header.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/v1/query` | Regulatory knowledge base query |
| POST | `/api/v1/check` | Single transaction compliance check |
| POST | `/api/v1/check/batch` | Batch check (up to 50 transactions) |
| POST | `/api/v1/screen/wallet` | Wallet risk assessment (OFAC + LLM) |
| POST | `/api/v1/report` | SAR/STR report generation |
| POST | `/api/v1/analyze` | Obligation extraction |
| POST | `/api/v1/webhooks` | Register a webhook |
| GET | `/api/v1/webhooks` | List webhooks |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/webhooks/:id` | Remove a webhook |
| GET | `/api/v1/usage` | Usage stats for current API key |
| GET | `/api/v1/audit` | Audit logs scoped to current API key |

### Admin Authentication

Admin API routes are protected by the `ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
# Start with admin auth enabled
ADMIN_TOKEN=your-secret-token ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... pnpm start:server
```

- **If `ADMIN_TOKEN` is set:** all admin API routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- **If `ADMIN_TOKEN` is not set:** admin routes are open (backward compatible), a warning is logged

The admin HTML dashboard (`GET /admin`) remains accessible without auth — it handles authentication via the token input in the UI header.

### Admin Endpoints

All admin API routes require the admin token when `ADMIN_TOKEN` is set.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/admin/api-keys` | Generate API key (accepts `organizationId`) |
| GET | `/admin/api-keys` | List all keys |
| DELETE | `/admin/api-keys/:id` | Revoke key |
| POST | `/admin/organizations` | Create organization |
| GET | `/admin/organizations` | List all organizations |
| GET | `/admin/organizations/:id` | Get organization details |
| GET | `/admin/audit` | Query all audit logs (with filters) |
| GET | `/admin` | Admin dashboard UI |
| POST | `/admin/screen/test` | Test address screening (sanctions only) |

## Phase 2: Regulated Yield Platform (Demo)

A demo yield platform showing how compliance-embedded yield vaults would work. For investor pitches only -- no real money.

### Vault Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:3000/vault-demo` after starting the server. 5 interactive tabs:

1. **Strategies** -- 3 vault cards with APY, composition breakdown, risk rating
2. **Portfolio** -- Total value, yield earned, allocation pie chart
3. **Performance** -- 90-day NAV line chart (SVG, zero dependencies)
4. **Deposit / Withdraw** -- Eligibility check + transaction forms
5. **Investor Onboarding** -- Registration + compliance screening flow

### Vault Strategies

| Vault | Composition | Target APY | Risk | Min Deposit |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Conservative** | 70% BUIDL + 20% USYC + 10% USDC | 3.8% | Low | $1,000 |
| **Balanced** | 40% BUIDL + 30% USDY + 20% USYC + 10% USDC | 4.3% | Medium | $5,000 |
| **Growth** | 30% BUIDL + 30% USDY + 25% sDAI + 15% USDC | 4.8% | Medium | $10,000 (accredited only) |

### Vault API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/vault/strategies` | List vault configs with current yields |
| GET | `/vault/performance/:vaultId` | Historical NAV data (query: `?days=90`) |
| POST | `/vault/deposit` | Deposit (checks compliance first) |

| GET | `/vault/investors/:id` | Get investor profile |
| GET | `/vault/investors` | List all investors |
| GET | `/vault/reports/:investorId` | Generate monthly report |

### Demo Investors

3 pre-seeded investors across jurisdictions:

| Name | Jurisdiction | Accredited |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Tanaka Hiroshi | FSA (Japan) | Yes |
| Lim Wei Ting | MAS (Singapore) | No |
| Chan Ka Ming | SFC (Hong Kong) | Yes |

---

## Phase 3: Product Depth

Four cross-cutting improvements that deepen the platform without adding any npm dependencies or breaking existing APIs.

### Semantic Search (TF-IDF)

The knowledge base now builds a TF-IDF index on every document added. Regulatory queries and compliance checks use cosine-similarity semantic search to find the most relevant documents instead of returning all docs for a jurisdiction. Falls back to jurisdiction-wide search when no results match.

### Pluggable Wallet Screening (OFAC SDN, Multi-Chain)

Wallet screening is now a two-stage pipeline supporting addresses from any blockchain:

1. **Provider check** -- all registered `ScreeningProvider`s are queried first. An exact match (e.g. OFAC SDN) returns immediately with `riskScore: 100`, `riskLevel: "critical"`.
2. **LLM analysis** -- if no exact sanctions hit, the LLM screening runs as before, augmented with provider context.

The `chain` parameter is optional -- address formats (Ethereum/EVM, Solana, Bitcoin) are auto-detected when omitted.

The built-in `OfacScreener` fetches the US Treasury's SDN address supplement (`add.csv`) and entity list (`sdn.csv`), parses all "Digital Currency Address" entries across all chains, and matches by exact normalized address. Data refreshes automatically every 24 hours.

Custom providers can be added by implementing the `ScreeningProvider` interface and registering with the `ScreeningRegistry`.

### Audit Logging

Every API operation is logged to an append-only audit trail. Events capture: API key, organization, action, resource, HTTP method, result (success/error/blocked), status code, client IP, and duration.

```bash
# Query all audit logs
curl localhost:3000/admin/audit

# Filter by action and result
curl "localhost:3000/admin/audit?action=check&result=success&limit=10"

# Authenticated users see only their own logs
curl localhost:3000/api/v1/audit -H "Authorization: Bearer complr_..."
```

Set the `AUDIT_LOG_FILE` environment variable to persist logs to a JSON-lines file.

### Custom Sanctions Screener

In addition to the built-in OFAC provider, you can load a custom sanctions list from a local JSON file:

```bash
# Create a sanctions file
echo '[{"address":"0xbad","entity":"Bad Actor","program":"CUSTOM","listEntry":"#1"}]' > sanctions.json

# Start with custom screener
CUSTOM_SANCTIONS_FILE=./sanctions.json ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... pnpm start:server
```

The custom screener performs exact case-insensitive address matching with confidence 1.0.

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

Organizations group API keys under a shared identity with aggregate rate limiting.

```bash
# Create an organization
curl -X POST localhost:3000/admin/organizations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Acme Exchange", "rateLimit": 300}'

# Generate an API key under the org
curl -X POST localhost:3000/admin/api-keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "acme-prod", "organizationId": "org_..."}'
```

- Per-key rate limiting still applies, plus an org-wide aggregate limit (separate sliding window)
- Regulatory documents with an `organizationId` are only visible to that org's keys via semantic search
- Seed data (no `organizationId`) remains visible to everyone

### File-Backed Persistence

Set `COMPLR_DATA_DIR` to persist organizations and API keys across server restarts:

```bash
COMPLR_DATA_DIR=/tmp/complr-data ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... pnpm start:server
```

Data is stored as JSON files with atomic writes. Without `COMPLR_DATA_DIR`, everything stays in-memory (backward compatible).

### Admin Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:3000/admin` for a web-based admin UI with 4 tabs:

1. **Organizations** — create and list organizations
2. **API Keys** — create, list, and revoke API keys
3. **Audit Log** — filterable, paginated audit event viewer
4. **Screening** — system health status and test address screening

### Automated Tests

~66 tests across 9 test files using `node:test` + `tsx`:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Tests cover: TF-IDF search, audit logging, organizations, API keys, OFAC screener, screening registry, knowledge base, admin auth middleware, and HTTP-level API integration tests.

## Jurisdictions

| Regulator | Region | Travel Rule Threshold |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| **MAS** | Singapore | S$1,500 (~USD 1,100) |
| **SFC** | Hong Kong | HK$8,000 (~USD 1,025) |
| **FSA** | Japan | Zero (all transactions) |

## Seed Regulatory Data

The knowledge base ships with 8 regulatory documents covering:

- MAS Payment Services Act (DPT licensing, Travel Rule, tokenisation guide)
- SFC ASPIRe roadmap, Travel Rule under AMLO, Stablecoins Ordinance
- FSA Travel Rule (JVCEA), crypto tax reform proposal

## Design Decisions

- **Zero new npm dependencies** -- uses native `fetch()`, `node:crypto`, inline SVG charts, hand-rolled TF-IDF and CSV parser
- **Optional file persistence** -- `COMPLR_DATA_DIR` enables JSON-file persistence for API keys and organizations via `JsonStore<T>`. Without it, everything stays in-memory (backward compat)
- **SDK is standalone** -- `packages/sdk/` with its own `package.json`, duplicates types intentionally for clean package separation
- **Legacy routes preserved** -- existing web UI at `/` continues to work without auth
- **Single Express server** -- SDK API (`/api/v1/*`), vault demo (`/vault/*`), and web UI all share one server
- **Audit everything** -- every API route is wrapped with `auditWrap` for automatic logging with zero per-handler boilerplate
- **Pluggable screening** -- `ScreeningProvider` interface lets you add new sanctions lists, PEP databases, or custom checks alongside the built-in OFAC screener

## Development

```bash
pnpm install        # Install all dependencies
pnpm build          # Build all packages (via turbo)
pnpm dev            # Watch mode
pnpm typecheck      # Type check without emitting
pnpm test           # Run all tests (~66 tests, 9 suites)
```

CI runs automatically on push/PR to `master` via GitHub Actions (Node 20, pnpm, build + test).

## QuickNode Marketplace Add-on

**Fabrknt Off-Chain Compliance** (`fabrknt-offchain-compliance`) is a QuickNode Marketplace add-on that exposes Complr's compliance engine as a managed service. Source lives in `packages/qn-addon/`.
