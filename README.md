# Complr

AI-Native Compliance Intelligence for Asia's Crypto Markets.

Complr is a multi-jurisdiction compliance engine covering **MAS** (Singapore), **SFC** (Hong Kong), and **FSA** (Japan). It uses LLMs to interpret regulatory text, check transactions against jurisdiction-specific rules, generate SAR/STR reports, and extract structured obligations from regulatory documents.

## Product Phases

| Phase | Name | Status | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| **0** | AI Compliance Agent | Complete | Core compliance engine with 4 features |
| **1** | Compliance Middleware SDK | MVP | `@complr/sdk` — npm-installable SDK for exchanges/VASPs |
| **2** | Regulated Yield Platform | Demo | Compliance-embedded yield vaults for investor pitches |

---

## Phase 0: Core Compliance Engine

### Features

- **Regulatory Queries** -- Ask natural language questions about crypto regulations and get jurisdiction-specific answers grounded in actual regulatory text
- **Transaction Compliance Checks** -- Submit a single transaction and get compliance results across all 3 jurisdictions simultaneously, including Travel Rule applicability, KYC requirements, and action items
- **SAR/STR Generation** -- Auto-draft Suspicious Transaction Reports in regulator-specific formats (FSA STR, MAS STR, SFC STR) in seconds
- **Obligation Extraction** -- Feed in regulatory documents and get structured, actionable obligations with thresholds, penalties, and suggested controls

### Web UI

Open `http://localhost:3000` after starting the server. 4 interactive tabs for all core features.

---

## Phase 1: Compliance Middleware SDK

The SDK wraps the compliance engine into an authenticated API that exchanges and VASPs can integrate via `npm install @complr/sdk`.

### SDK Features

- **Authenticated API** -- Bearer token auth with per-key rate limiting
- **Batch Compliance Checks** -- Check up to 50 transactions in parallel
- **Wallet Risk Screening** -- LLM-powered wallet address risk assessment
- **Webhook Delivery** -- HMAC-signed webhook notifications with exponential backoff retry
- **Usage Tracking** -- Per-key request counts and usage statistics
- **TypeScript-first** -- Full type definitions, zero dependencies

### SDK Quick Start

```typescript
import { ComplrClient } from "@complr/sdk";

const complr = new ComplrClient({
  apiKey: "complr_...",
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
});

// Single transaction check
const result = await complr.checkTransaction({
  transactionId: "tx_001",
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  senderWallet: "0xabc...",
  recipientWallet: "0xdef...",
  amount: "10000",
  currency: "USDC",
  chain: "ethereum",
});

// Batch check
const batch = await complr.checkBatch(transactions);

// Wallet screening
const screen = await complr.screenWallet("0xabc...", "ethereum", "MAS");

// Webhook management
await complr.registerWebhook("https://your-app.com/webhooks", ["check.blocked", "screen.high_risk"], "your-secret");
```

### API Key Management

```bash
# Generate an API key
curl -X POST localhost:3000/admin/api-keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-exchange"}'

# List all keys
curl localhost:3000/admin/api-keys

# Revoke a key
curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/admin/api-keys/ak_xxx
```

### V1 API Endpoints

All `/api/v1/*` routes require a Bearer token via the `Authorization` header.

## Phase 2: Regulated Yield Platform (Demo)

A demo yield platform showing how compliance-embedded yield vaults would work. For investor pitches only -- no real money.

### Vault Dashboard

1. **Strategies** -- 3 vault cards with APY, composition breakdown, risk rating
2. **Portfolio** -- Total value, yield earned, allocation pie chart
3. **Performance** -- 90-day NAV line chart (SVG, zero dependencies)
4. **Deposit / Withdraw** -- Eligibility check + transaction forms
5. **Investor Onboarding** -- Registration + compliance screening flow

### Vault Strategies

| Vault | Composition | Target APY | Risk | Min Deposit |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Conservative** | 70% BUIDL + 20% USYC + 10% USDC | 3.8% | Low | $1,000 |
| **Balanced** | 40% BUIDL + 30% USDY + 20% USYC + 10% USDC | 4.3% | Medium | $5,000 |
| **Growth** | 30% BUIDL + 30% USDY + 25% sDAI + 15% USDC | 4.8% | Medium | $10,000 (accredited only) |

### Vault API Endpoints

| Name | Jurisdiction | Accredited |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Tanaka Hiroshi | FSA (Japan) | Yes |
| Lim Wei Ting | MAS (Singapore) | No |
| Chan Ka Ming | SFC (Hong Kong) | Yes |

## Jurisdictions

| Regulator | Region | Travel Rule Threshold |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| **MAS** | Singapore | S$1,500 (~USD 1,100) |
| **SFC** | Hong Kong | HK$8,000 (~USD 1,025) |
| **FSA** | Japan | Zero (all transactions) |

## Seed Regulatory Data

The knowledge base ships with 8 regulatory documents covering:

- MAS Payment Services Act (DPT licensing, Travel Rule, tokenisation guide)
- SFC ASPIRe roadmap, Travel Rule under AMLO, Stablecoins Ordinance
- FSA Travel Rule (JVCEA), crypto tax reform proposal

## Design Decisions

- **Zero new npm dependencies** -- uses native `fetch()`, `node:crypto`, inline SVG charts
- **In-memory everything** -- all state (API keys, vaults, investors) stored in `Map<string, T>`. Server restart resets. Easy to migrate to a database later
- **SDK is standalone** -- `sdk/` directory with its own `package.json`, duplicates types intentionally for clean package separation
- **Legacy routes preserved** -- existing web UI at `/` continues to work without auth
- **Single Express server** -- SDK API (`/api/v1/*`), vault demo (`/vault/*`), and web UI all share one server

## Development

```bash
npm run build       # Compile TypeScript
npm run dev         # Watch mode
npm run typecheck   # Type check without emitting
```
